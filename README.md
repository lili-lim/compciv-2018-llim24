#Final project summary
My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many amendments are submitted to annual report filings for current and past senators. A visualization idea is to show a graph of number of amendments per state per year. Or to divide it up by party (R/D) or gender.

Failure to disclose assets seems to be a common problem for our wealthy senators, and seeing if there is any increase in amendments according to certain factors might prove to be an interesting story.

"The Republican Senator had failed to disclose $2 million in income from three hedge fund investments and additional millions from real-estate investments as well as other assets and financial transactions, the Journal reports. The fully amended filings show at least $3.8 million in additional income between 2007 and 2014 from commercial real-estate holdings."

Excuses: 
*"A spokesperson for Corker responded to the organization’s plans by saying, “These baseless ‎accusations from a political special interest group are categorically false and nothing more than a smear campaign.”

"Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary pick of President-elect Donald Trump, initially failed to disclose $95 million in real estate holdings to the Senate Finance Committee. Mnuchin, a wealthy Wall Street executive, also failed to disclose his position as director of a corporation in the Cayman Islands, a well-known offshore tax haven, according to a memo from the Senate Finance Committee's Democratic staff. The undisclosed information, which also included about $907,000 worth of artwork held by his children, was not on the committee questionnaire Mnuchin submitted on Dec. 19."

Excuses: 
*"I think as you all can appreciate, filing out these government forms is quite complicated," Mnuchin said.
*He said the omissions were caused by trying to get the questionnaire to the committee early and advice from his attorney that the information did not need to be disclosed.

"The holdings are small, producing revenue in the range of $4,700 annually. But the interests were not disclosed on forms sent by Sessions to the Office of Government Ethics, which reviews the assets of Cabinet nominees for potential conflicts of interest. ... 'I am troubled by any omissions,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee. “But this is particularly troubling because this ownership interest involves oil and gas holdings connected to a federal wildlife refuge.'"

Excuses:
*"Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to rush through President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks before ethics checks can be completed"

"Earlier this week, the Washington Post discovered that Sessions had failed to disclose oil lease income from land he owns in the Choctaw National Wildlife Refuge. The land has been leased to an oil company, the paper reported. “We reported the income on my [tax] return as coming from the property I own and the property the oil well is on,” Sessions told fellow senators during his confirmation hearing Tuesday." 

Excuses:
*“I did not note in [the financial disclosures] report that it was specifically oil income.”"

“What is surprising is that these violations are so egregious,” Fischer said in an email. “This is not some complicated area of law. We are talking about a simple financial disclosure form with clear instructions, which asks for information very similar to what Moore had already reported to Alabama a few months prior. Moore was the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, so he can’t possibly claim that the simple instructions for filling out the Senate Financial Disclosure form were too difficult for him to follow.”

Excuses:
*Moore’s financial reporting discrepancies were troubling for a federal candidate ostensibly well versed in the law.
